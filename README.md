# Gaia Bot
Game Action Interactivity Accumulator. Entertain your audience with games.

The point of the bot is to play text games in the chat. However, due to time constraints I could do a limited number of adlibs puzzles.

This bot is meant for Discord's Hackweek.
The prefix is `g#` or `G#`

I am proud of this bot because I wrote it all myself without anyone else to aide.
